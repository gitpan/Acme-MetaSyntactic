        [BIG FUX]
        - themes() didn't work correctly in scalar context.
        [SMILL FAX]
        - meta did issue a warning when called without arguments.
          Rafael Garcia-Suarez provided a patch, which I modified
          so that no args means default theme.

        [ANNOUNCE]
        - From now on, releases should happen on a weekly
          basis, every monday morning (CET)... A new list every week!
        - Email me with suggestions (and lists).
        [STUPID ME]
        - 0.04 was released too soon, so this version:
          + puts the coverage back at 100% (one missing test in 0.04
            had the coverage fall to 97.8%. Darn.)
          + removes the compromising "log" file (which was there since 0.01)
          + removes the "Build" file (which was there since 0.01, as well)
        [TOOLS]
        - script/meta is a simple front-end, useful with $EDITOR
