        [NEW WEEKLY THEME 2005/04/11]
        - elements (Sébastien Aperghis-Tramoni)
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - now looks for Acme::MetaSyntactic themes everywhere in @INC
          (not only in the directory where Acme::MetaSyntactic is installed)
        - better documentation for Acme::MetaSyntactic::Locale
        [BUGFIX]
        - load_data() does not destroy $_ any more
        - the bugfix in 0.16 did not fix the "whitespace in install dir" bug,
          but the @INC enhancement did (thanks to Olivier Mengué for pointing
          me to File::Glob)

        [NEW WEEKLY THEME 2005/04/04]
        - haddock (Jérôme Fenal)
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - The new Acme::MetaSyntactic::Locale allows for multilingual themes
        - The first theme to use this behaviour is "haddock"
        - Still 100% coverage (even cover Win32 code under Unix)
        [BUGFIX]
        - Corrected a bug that only appeared if Acme::MetaSyntactic
          was installed in directories containing whitespace
          (thanks to Max Maischein for testing under such conditions!)

        - loremipsum (Jérôme Fenal)

0.12 Sun Mar  6 20:15:11 CET 2005
        [ENHANCEMENTS]
        - To prevent endless growth of the Acme::MetaSyntactic module,
          and support various theme behaviours, support for behaviour
          classes has been added.
        - The first behaviour class is Acme::MetaSyntactic::List, which
          reproduces the previous behaviour of selecting a number
          of random items from a list, with no repetition until
          the list is exhausted.
        - The 17 existing themes have been converted to the new scheme.
        [USAGE]
        - Acme::MetaSyntactic is a dependency for a least one module!
          Praise Bot::MetaSyntactic, which is the core of the meta bot
          running on irc://irc.perl.org/perlfr
        [INCOMPATIBILITIES]
        - the API has changed a little:
          + Acme::MetaSyntactic does not has methods named after the
            themes any more
          + The name() method now accept the theme name as its first
            parameter
          + name( [ $theme, ] 0 ) now returns the full list of names
        [COVERAGE]
        - Code coverage is still 100%, but I had to resort to a hack
          to achieve this feat.
        [NEW BEHAVIOURS]
        - Acme::MetaSyntactic::List is the classic "random item from a list"
          that existed until now
        [ANNOUNCE]
        - More behaviour subclasses will follow!
        [NEW WEEKLY THEMES 2005/03/07]
        - any     [a metatheme (!) that returns names from a random theme]
        - dancers [a birthday gift and homage to my wife,
                   who was born on March 7th, 30 years ago]
        [THEME UPDATE]
        - toto (Jérôme Fenal)

        [BIG FUX]
        - themes() didn't work correctly in scalar context.
        [SMILL FAX]
        - meta did issue a warning when called without arguments.
          Rafael Garcia-Suarez provided a patch, which I modified
          so that no args means default theme.
        [NEW WEEKLY THEME 2005/01/24]
        - tld (Scott Lanning suggested ISO 3166 country codes)

0.05 Sun Jan 16 18:30:29 CET 2005
        [ANNOUNCE]
        - From now on, releases should happen on a weekly
          basis, every monday morning (CET)... A new list every week!
        - Email me with suggestions (and lists).
        [STUPID ME]
        - 0.04 was released too soon, so this version:
          + puts the coverage back at 100% (one missing test in 0.04
            had the coverage fall to 97.8%. Darn.)
          + removes the compromising "log" file (which was there since 0.01)
          + removes the "Build" file (which was there since 0.01, as well)
        [TOOLS]
        - script/meta is a simple front-end, useful with $EDITOR
        [THEMES]
        - New theme:
          + browser (with a little help from Sébastien Aperghis-Tramoni)

          + simpsons

0.03 Fri Jan 14 21:39:03 CET 2005
        - Documentation patches
        - Put everything in __DATA__ to make adding new themes easier
        - New themes (the names in parentheses indicate who suggested
