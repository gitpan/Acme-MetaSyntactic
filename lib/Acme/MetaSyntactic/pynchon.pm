Acme::MetaSyntactic::pynchon - The Pynchon theme

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Character names from Thomas Pynchon's books.

David Landgren not only named all the machines in the C<mongueurs.net>
domain (C<stencil>, C<sferics> and C<profane>) after characters from
Thomas Pynchon's books, but also provided a first list.

The pynchon list will probably grow in future versions, as David goes
through his books.
