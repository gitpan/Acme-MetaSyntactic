=head1 NAME

eta - A shortcut for Acme::MetaSyntactic one-liners

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $ perl -Meta -E say+metaname
    plugh

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Typing the module full name in oneliners is more than cumbersome.

Yes, there's already the meta(1) command for simple cases like this one,
but for more complex cases combining several themes it's really better.
